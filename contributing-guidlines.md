## Adding to this list

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Use [title-casing](http://titlecapitalization.com) (AP style).
- Use the following format: `[List Name](link)`
- Link additions should be added in alphabetical order to the relevant category.

- The pull request and commit should have a useful title.

Thank you for your suggestions!

## Deleting from this list

I want to keep this list as tight and lean as possible, so if you have a good argument as to why something should be removed, please send me a pull request. Please adhere to the following simple guidelines.

- Have an argument/explanation of why your pull is removing something
- Make an individual pull request for each removal
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace, and uses unix (LF) line-endings

## Updating your Pull Request

Sometimes, a maintainer of an awesome list will ask you to edit your Pull Request before it is included. This is normally due to spelling errors or because your PR didn't match the awesome-* list guidelines.

[Here](https://github.com/RichardLitt/docs/blob/master/amending-a-commit-guide.md) is a write up on how to change a Pull Request, and the different ways you can do that.
